You can use: "make" command to build the project
To launch: "./out/a.out"

To clean: "make clean"

I put both the executables and the generated files in the out directory to avoid clutter.
./out/a.out = program that you want to run
./out/add.out = generated file for addition
./out/matrix.o = matrix executable
./out/mult.out = generated file for multiplication
./out/reader.out = reader executable
./out/sub.out = generated file for subtraction
